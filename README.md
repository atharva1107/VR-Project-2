The goal of the game is to find the items on the item list and get them as safely (exposure) and quickly (timer) as possible. Other factors and challenges may appear.

HUD elements
Covid Meter or "Exposure" works like a health bar.
Highlight sources of contact (risks of exposure, people, etc).
Damage Indicator - points to direction of source of contact when too close - 6ft.
Timer counts down - (maybe doesn't stop, but penalizes for taking too long)

Points/Grade based system - Awarded points based on how a user performs the task.
Different Locations - grocery/electronics, etc.
Change difficulty - e.g. add more sources of contact, less time, etc.

Educating users - precautionary steps to follow so it works as an educational/social theme.
Total points based on health, time, items, etc (may add or subtract other points based on other factors).
