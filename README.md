## Introduction

The goal of the game is to find the items on the item list and get them as safely (exposure) and quickly (timer) as possible. Other factors and challenges may appear.

## Initial Scene

When the game is first opened up, the user is taken to th grocery store scene and a randomly generated checklist is generated. This checklist is to be followed by the player to pickup items from the store while maintaining safe distance from other people spawned in the environment. 

<br />

Following is the initial scene of the game:

The player has to complete all the items in the list with maintaining safe distance from other or the player loses health:

We can see in the above picture that the player failed to socially distance from others and lost some health
